    - Text Cleaning (TRIM, PROPER)
    - VLOOKUP for data matching and retrieval

### Data Analysis Steps:

1. Imported and cleaned sales data using TRIM and PROPER functions.
2. Extracted relevant customer information using LEFT, MID, and RIGHT functions.
3. Standardized customer names and addresses.
4. Used VLOOKUP to match customer data with sales records.
5. Analyzed sales trends using SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, MAXIF, and MINIF functions.

### Skills Demonstrated:

### Project 3: Employee Database Management using SQL

### Objective: Design and manage an employee database using SQL, demonstrating proficiency in querying and manipulating data.

### Tasks:

1. Create a database schema for employee data (tables: Employees, Departments, Salaries).
2. Insert sample data into each table.
3. Write queries to:
    - Retrieve employee information (filtering, sorting, grouping).
    - Calculate aggregate values (e.g., average salary by department).
    - Update employee records.
    - Delete inactive employees.
4. Implement SQL joins to combine employee and department data.
5. Create views for simplified data access.

### Deliverables:

1. SQL script (employee_db.sql) containing:
    - Database schema creation.
    - Sample data insertion.
    - Queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
  
### Database Query

### Description
Retrieve all columns (*) from the employee table.

``` SQL Query
SELECT * FROM employee
Where department = ('ACCOUNT')
```
